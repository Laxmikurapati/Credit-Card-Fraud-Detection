## Introduction

Welcome to SecureGuard, our mission is to ensure the safety of credit card transactions! In this project, we focused on detecting credit card fraud by preparing the data, creating useful features, and addressing the challenge of imbalanced data. By employing various techniques like undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, and ensemble methods, we trained powerful Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to defend against fraudulent activities. 🚀🌐💻

## The Challenge of Imbalanced Data

One of the challenges we faced was dealing with imbalanced data. There were very few cases of fraud compared to the legitimate transactions. To handle this, we balanced the dataset to give our models a fair chance at detecting fraud effectively. ⚖️🔍📊

## Data Preparation & Feature Creation

Before tackling fraud, we prepared the data and engineered features. This involved refining the raw information and extracting valuable characteristics from the transactions. These improvements equipped our models with the necessary tools to identify suspicious patterns. 🛠️🔍💡

## Undersampling & Oversampling

To address the imbalance, we used two strategies. We reduced the number of genuine transactions (undersampling) and increased the instances of fraudulent transactions (oversampling). This helped us create a more balanced environment for our models. ⚖️📉📈

## SMOTE - Balancing the Data with Magic

SMOTE was our magic spell to combat the imbalance. It created synthetic fraudulent transactions that resembled real fraud, providing additional examples for the models to learn from. 🧙‍♂️💨🧪

## Ensemble Methods for Extra Power

To strengthen our defense, we employed ensemble methods. By combining multiple ANN models, we formed a powerful alliance that worked together to identify potential fraud with even greater accuracy. 🤝🔝💪

## The Shield Against Fraud: ANN Models

With everything set, our ANN models took the spotlight. These smart warriors were trained to detect patterns and tell apart legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones. Armed with the knowledge from data preparation and ensemble methods, our ANNs are committed to keeping credit card transactions secure. 🛡️🤖🛡️
